# Running Flask on Architect

This example will show you the use-case for using Python on Architect leveraging the Flask tutorial application â€“ [Flaskr](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/tutorial/). In this example, we've written a component spec (the `architect.yml` file) that defines a component to run a Flask based web application.

[Learn more about the architect.yml file](//docs.architect.io/configuration)

## Running locally

Architect component specs are declarative, so it can be run locally or remotely with a single deploy command:

```sh
# Clone the repository and navigate to this directory
$ git clone https://github.com/architect-templates/flask.git
$ cd flask

# Deploy using the dev command
$ architect dev architect.yml
```

Once the deploy has completed, you can reach your new service by going to http://web.arc.localhost/.

Default values of `flask_port` has been set. Modify this parameter on the top of the `architect.yml` file.

```yaml
parameters:
  flask_port:
    default: 5000
```
